// The FM-1's boot loader: it's in the chip's ROM (JieLi WL82), so no firmware can break it. A running FM-1 goes there
// when it's sent F0 22 24 35 7D F7 (stock V15, and the firmwares on Felucca's platform: fomajam ...), and it's then a
// USB storage device (4C4A:8057, "WL80UBOOT1.00") answering JieLi's own commands, until it's told to start its
// firmware again. With JieLi's loader in its RAM (wl82loader.bin, from jl-uboot-tool: downloaded once, to the SD
// card) it reads the whole flash: the firmware, and what the firmwares keep (settings, projects, samples, voices).
//
// An FM-1 whose firmware doesn't start gets there by the key its chip listens for when it's switched on (hal.h
// recoveryMode), and then has a firmware or a backup written back (recovery: writeSector); backups only read.
//
// The protocol is as FM-1-transporter (kurogedelic, MIT) and jl-uboot-tool (kagaimiq, MIT) speak it: their
// docs/PROTOCOL.md says how.
