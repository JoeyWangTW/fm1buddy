// Sounds: SysEx to and from the FM-1 (or any device on the hub), kept on the SD card as .syx files in /syx.
//
// Setups: a firmware that shares (fomajam, through foma's platform/src/share.c) gives its song, and its kits of
// samples (kits.h). They're kept on the SD card in a setup, a folder in /setups (setup-1/fomajam.bin, fomajam-kits.bin,
// and kits/ for kits as folders of .wav files), and loaded back later: one setup per song played, say.
//
// Any firmware: a .syx file is sent as it is, and whatever the device sends is recorded into one (most firmwares that
// can send their sounds do it from a menu on the device). On top of that, what the device's firmware speaks is asked
// (probe): the stock firmware's voice read, Felucca's editor protocol, M-VAVE Open's; each gets more later.
