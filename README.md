All without a computer/phone/etc:

- Switch the M-VAVE FM-1's firmware, on the fly (from the SD card, or the [FM-1 Firmware Hub](https://thefirmwarehub.com) and download over Wi-Fi, from [the firmware hub](https://thefirmwarehub.com/))
- Play it from cheap USB-only (up to 4, on a hub) and Bluetooth MIDI devices, even if FM-1 firmware only supports USB MIDI
- touchscreen
- nice themed menus
- Backup flash/settings/presets/etc (from stock V15, or any firmware)
- Send/record sounds (.syx, like DX7 banks)
- MIDI-routing: Bluetooth & USB devices pass notes, clock & controls to each other, or map them with rules in `midimap.txt` on the SD card (say, several controllers each onto their own FM-1 channel). Add and delete rules by touch, split a keyboard at any key, transpose, and set or scale velocity.
- MIDI clock: lead at a tempo (tap tempo, start/stop) or follow a device's clock, with a light on each beat
- Arpeggiator (up, down, up-down, random, as played; 1/4 to 1/32; up to 4 octaves; hold) and chord memory, for any controller (the FM-1's own notes are left alone)
- Record the FM-1's audio to WAV files on the SD card, over USB, with level meters and a clip warning (firmware that sends USB audio: Felucca, and those built on it like SLOOP; any class-compliant USB mic or sound card works too)
- Touchscreen MIDI controller: a two-finger X/Y pad (each finger sends 2 CCs, and can play notes on a scale) and 16 velocity-sensitive pads. It's a controller like any other, so mapping rules, clock, arp and chords work on it
- Choose what it starts on: firmware manager, MIDI hub, mapper, or touch controller
- USB MIDI for a computer: plugged straight into one, it's a class-compliant USB MIDI device (Settings > On a computer), so the touch controller, clock and Bluetooth MIDI devices reach your DAW, and the DAW can play them
- Warns before you install firmware with no backup of the FM-1 on the SD card, with a button to make one
- Sample-management (folders of WAV to its sample-banks, and back)
- SLOOP (2.3+): back it up in SLOOP's own file (they open in its web editor, and its backups open here), restore one, load a single project from one, and load folders of WAVs into its sample slots. The Sounds page says what the firmware on the FM-1 can do, and what to install for more
- Sample slots on Felucca and the firmwares built on it that kept them (Skiff, JIANT, Melodee, ...): load a folder of WAVs (or one WAV) from `/sloop/samples` into USR1-3, for its SAMPLE engine. fomajam's drum kits load from setups
- Act as USB disk (to manage files on SD)
- MIDI-out, turn FM1 into a sequencer (on supported firmware, like [fomajam](https://github.com/konsumer/fomajam))
- FM1 Recover: enter the FM-1 recovery ROM over USB, like [FM-1-transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter), with no extra wiring. The opt-in Hosyond profile has completed a verified stock-V15 restore; the default profile's arbitrary firmware/backup restore remains unvalidated on hardware. See [recovery profiles](#hosyond-esp32-s3-recovery).
- Automation options, great for LLM development: switch it into USB MIDI mode from the serial console (`tools/s3.py usbmidi`), and back with a "magic" SysEx message (`tools/s3.py serial`), so tests can run on the real thing.

It should be useful for most firmware, depending on what it supports, but it has some extra stuff that is specific to [fomajam](https://github.com/konsumer/fomajam):

- load/save song
- load/save sample-banks quickly (for swapping sets at a live show)
- export as MIDI/WAV for use n other programs

No soldering or assembly needed, just get a cheap [Freenove ESP32-S3 2.8"](https://store.freenove.com/products/fnk0104?variant=45040270213318) (FNK0104B.) It comes in other sizes too, but the firmware is made for this exact model (its screen, touch and SD pins). You might additionally need a USB power-splitter and/or a small USB hub, depending on what you are doing.

## Development

With [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org), the board on the computer (it's a USB serial port there; on a hub, the USB
host):

```sh
pio run -e cyd-s3 -t upload
```

The app also runs on the desktop (SDL2: `brew install sdl2`), with pretend Wi-Fi, an FM-1 and a keyboard. It runs
headless from a script too, for screenshots:

```sh
pio run -e sim && .pio/build/sim/program --fm1 --keys
.pio/build/sim/program --headless --script "tap 24 142; wait 300; shot settings.bmp; quit"
```

`tools/unit-test.sh` runs the tests of the MIDI mapping's rules and SLOOP's formats (`test/`: a sample slot made from
.wav files must be the bytes SLOOP's own `tools/sampleio.py` makes). `--sloop` makes the simulator's FM-1 one running
SLOOP 2.8, `--felucca` one running Felucca 1.6.1 (its 3 sample slots). `--theme NAME` shows it in one of the themes (WHITE, NEON, ...), to check a page in all of them. `--clock` gives the simulator's keyboard
MIDI clock to follow; `press X Y`, `release`, `finger2 X Y` and `lift2` in a script hold fingers down, for the touch
controller.

`tools/install-test.sh` installs a package on the pretend FM-1, cleanly and with faults (lost and repeated requests,
garbled answers, unplugged while writing), and checks it ends up exactly as the package.

Each install on the board writes what went between it and the FM-1 to `fm1buddy/installs/N.txt` on the SD card (the
last 10 are kept): send one along with a report of an install gone wrong.

`tools/s3.py` (with `~/.platformio/penv/bin/python`) does the same on the board: `shot FILE`, `tap X Y`, `drag X1 Y1 X2 Y2`, `log` (what it
logged on the hub, also in `fm1buddy/log.txt` on its SD card), `host` (the USB host for 40 s, running an optional script of `tap X Y` and `wait MS` steps), and `usbmidi` / `serial`
(it restarts as a USB MIDI device for the computer, and back: `serial` sends it a SysEx of its own,
`F0 7D 66 6D 31 62 01 F7`, and needs `pip install python-rtmidi`), to test USB MIDI from a script.

```
src/app/   the app (LVGL 9): pages, the Hub's list, MIDI between devices, the FM-1's update protocol, sounds (SysEx),
           setups and fomajam's kits and MIDI files (sounds, kits, songmidi), backups (uboot);
           hal.h is what it needs from the board
src/s3/    the board: screen, touch, SD, Wi-Fi, USB host (TinyUSB), Bluetooth MIDI (NimBLE)
src/sim/   the simulator
site/      the installer page (GitHub Pages, with the latest release)
case/      the 3D-printed case (OpenSCAD); tools/cases.sh makes its STLs
```

## Hosyond ESP32-S3 recovery

Two opt-in profiles support the Hosyond / LCDWiki ES3C28P ESP32-S3 N16R8 display board. Recovery uses paired RMT channels and Espressif's USB host; normal MIDI, audio, Hub and computer/disk operation keep TinyUSB.

| Build profile | Recovery | Hub installs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cyd-s3` (default) | Existing TinyUSB backend | Existing installer |
| `hosyond-diagnostic` | Read-only ROM entry and verified full backup | Disabled |
| `hosyond-recovery` | Verified backup, V15 dry run and guarded stock-V15 restore | Enabled, with a battery check before starting |

On one Hosyond board and FM-1, the integrated recovery completed a zero-write dry run and a stock restore with all 143 changed sectors and the full 1 MiB flash verified. The owner also reports a successful Hub install. These results do not establish support for other ESP32-S3 boards or validate the default recovery writer.

Start with the [hardware and diagnostic guide](docs/hosyond-recovery.md), then [stock bundle preparation and restore controls](docs/hosyond-restore.md). The [validation record](docs/hosyond-validation.md) distinguishes captured evidence, user reports and remaining gaps. Flashing can leave the FM-1 unable to start if power or communication fails; keep verified private backups and both devices charged.
