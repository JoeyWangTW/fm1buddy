# fm1buddy

All without a computer/phone/etc:

- Switch the M-VAVE FM-1's firmware, on the fly (from the SD card, or the [FM-1 Firmware Hub](https://thefirmwarehub.com) and download over Wi-Fi, from [the firmware hub](https://thefirmwarehub.com/))
- Play it from cheap USB-only (up to 4, on a hub) and Bluetooth MIDI devices, even if FM-1 firmware only supports USB MIDI
- touchscreen
- nice themed menus
- Backup flash/settings/presets/etc (from stock V15, or any firmware)
- Send/record sounds (.syx, like DX7 banks)
- MIDI-routing: Bluetooth & USB devices pass notes, clock & controls to each other, or map them with rules in `midimap.txt` on the SD card (say, several controllers each onto their own FM-1 channel). Add and delete rules by touch, split a keyboard at any key, transpose, and set or scale velocity.
- MIDI clock: lead at a tempo (tap tempo, start/stop) or follow a device's clock, with a light on each beat
- Arpeggiator (up, down, up-down, random, as played; 1/4 to 1/32; up to 4 octaves; hold) and chord memory, for any controller (the FM-1's own notes are left alone)
- Touchscreen MIDI controller: a two-finger X/Y pad (each finger sends 2 CCs, and can play notes on a scale) and 16 velocity-sensitive pads. It's a controller like any other, so mapping rules, clock, arp and chords work on it
- Choose what it starts on: firmware manager, MIDI hub, mapper, or touch controller
- USB MIDI for a computer: plugged straight into one, it's a class-compliant USB MIDI device (Settings > On a computer), so the touch controller, clock and Bluetooth MIDI devices reach your DAW, and the DAW can play them
- Warns before you install firmware with no backup of the FM-1 on the SD card, with a button to make one
- Sample-management (folders of WAV to its sample-banks, and back)
- Act as USB disk (to manage files on SD)
- MIDI-out, turn FM1 into a sequencer (on supported firmware, like [fomajam](https://github.com/konsumer/fomajam))
- FM1 Recover: write a firmware or backup to an FM-1 that won't start, like [FM-1-transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter) with no wiring needed (when people say "use RP2040"). Not tested on a real FM-1 yet

It should be useful for most firmware, depending on what it supports, but it has some extra stuff that is specific to [fomajam](https://github.com/konsumer/fomajam):

- load/save song
- load/save sample-banks quickly (for swapping sets at a live show)
- export as MIDI/WAV for use n other programs

No soldering or assembly needed, just get a cheap [Freenove ESP32-S3 2.8"](https://store.freenove.com/products/fnk0104?variant=45040270213318) (FNK0104B.) It comes in other sizes too, but the firmware is made for this exact model (its screen, touch and SD pins). You might additionally need a USB power-splitter and/or a small USB hub, depending on what you are doing.

## Development

With [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org), the board on the computer (it's a USB serial port there; on a hub, the USB
host):

```sh
pio run -e cyd-s3 -t upload
```

The app also runs on the desktop (SDL2: `brew install sdl2`), with pretend Wi-Fi, an FM-1 and a keyboard. It runs
headless from a script too, for screenshots:

```sh
pio run -e sim && .pio/build/sim/program --fm1 --keys
.pio/build/sim/program --headless --script "tap 24 142; wait 300; shot settings.bmp; quit"
```

`tools/unit-test.sh` runs the tests of the MIDI mapping's rules (`test/`). `--clock` gives the simulator's keyboard
MIDI clock to follow; `press X Y`, `release`, `finger2 X Y` and `lift2` in a script hold fingers down, for the touch
controller.

`tools/install-test.sh` installs a package on the pretend FM-1, cleanly and with faults (lost and repeated requests,
garbled answers, unplugged while writing), and checks it ends up exactly as the package.

Each install on the board writes what went between it and the FM-1 to `fm1buddy/installs/N.txt` on the SD card (the
last 10 are kept): send one along with a report of an install gone wrong.

`tools/s3.py` (with `~/.platformio/penv/bin/python`) does the same on the board: `shot FILE`, `tap X Y`, `drag X1 Y1 X2 Y2`, `log` (what it
logged on the hub, also in `fm1buddy/log.txt` on its SD card), and `host` (the USB host for 20 s).

```
src/app/   the app (LVGL 9): pages, the Hub's list, MIDI between devices, the FM-1's update protocol, sounds (SysEx),
           setups and fomajam's kits and MIDI files (sounds, kits, songmidi), backups (uboot);
           hal.h is what it needs from the board
src/s3/    the board: screen, touch, SD, Wi-Fi, USB host (TinyUSB), Bluetooth MIDI (NimBLE)
src/sim/   the simulator
site/      the installer page (GitHub Pages, with the latest release)
case/      the 3D-printed case (OpenSCAD); tools/cases.sh makes its STLs
```
